Game Rules:<br>
<br>
The possibility to exit the starting position is granted to a player only when they roll a 6 on the dice.<br>
If a player rolls a 6, they can roll again.<br>
If the current player lands on a position occupied by another player's piece, that player's piece must return to the starting area (it is kicked out of the game).<br>
A player cannot land on a position with another player's piece; they must choose a piece that can move. If no piece can move, the next player takes a turn.<br>
Players cannot move pieces that are already in the home column (final positions). They must roll the exact value needed to move a piece into an open position in the home column. If <br>unsuccessful, the next player takes a turn.<br>
If a player rolls a 6 and has a piece in the corresponding colored starting area (spawn), the piece in the starting area cannot enter the game.<br>
The winner is the first player to have all four pieces in the home column.<br>
The game ends when all players have their pieces in the home column (player rankings are determined).<br>
There can be a maximum of four players.<br>
The game can be saved; this means that upon future launches, there is an option to continue a saved game, which is stored in a text document named save.txt.<br>
