# DontGetAngryGame
Game Controls for "Človeče Nehnevaj Sa!" (Dont get angry!):
Clicking - first, click on the dice, then on the piece you want to move.

Game Rules:

The possibility to exit the starting position is granted to a player only when they roll a 6 on the dice.
If a player rolls a 6, they can roll again.
If the current player lands on a position occupied by another player's piece, that player's piece must return to the starting area (it is kicked out of the game).
A player cannot land on a position with another player's piece; they must choose a piece that can move. If no piece can move, the next player takes a turn.
Players cannot move pieces that are already in the home column (final positions). They must roll the exact value needed to move a piece into an open position in the home column. If unsuccessful, the next player takes a turn.
If a player rolls a 6 and has a piece in the corresponding colored starting area (spawn), the piece in the starting area cannot enter the game.
The winner is the first player to have all four pieces in the home column.
The game ends when all players have their pieces in the home column (player rankings are determined).
There can be a maximum of four players.
The game can be saved; this means that upon future launches, there is an option to continue a saved game, which is stored in a text document named save.txt.
